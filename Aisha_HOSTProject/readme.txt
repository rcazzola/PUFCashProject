=========
This is code builds on the code from lab8, and provides some solutions and guidance on how to implement AliceWithdrawal.
You will see 'ADD CODE' comments through out the AliceWithdrawal() functions in device_regeneration.c, ttp_DB.c and
verifier_regeneration.c

I may end up doing something similar for AliceTransfer and BobDeposit as we progress through the next couple weeks.
You should get AliceWithdrawal working first.

All the supplemental libraries are the same as lab8, and are not included here.

Please let me know if you find any bugs or want to make any recommendations on what is not clear.
